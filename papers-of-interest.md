A. Rich and T. Gureckis, 2018

Learning usually improves the accuracy of beliefs through the accumulation of experience. 
But are there limits to learning that prevent us from accurately understanding our world? In this paper we investigate the concept of a “learning trap”—the formation of a stable false belief even with extensive experience. 
Our review highlights how these traps develop though the interaction of learning and decision making in unknown environments.

Coenen, Nelson & Gureckis - 2017

Perhaps the most successful and influential account of such abilities is the Optimal Experiment Design (OED) hypothesis, which argues that humans intuitively perform experiments on the world similar to the way an effective scientist plans an experiment.
Despite many successes, we argue that the OED hypothesis remains lacking as a theory of human inquiry and that research in the area often fails to confront some of the most interesting and important questions. 
In this critical review, we raise and discuss nine open questions about the psychology of human inquiry.
